Notes about beye xlat tables
============================

There is not special compiler/assembler for xlat tables which are used by beye.
You can code them yourself with using beye or any other hexadecimal editor.

The internal structure of these files is very simple:

1. File must have size 320(140h) bytes.

2. File must contain:

 Offset |   Length  |   Values
 -------+-----------+---------------------------
 00h:   |   10h     |   Beye Xlat Table. 
 10h:   |   30h     |   Description of table
 40h:   |  100h     |   Body of table
 -------+-----------+---------------------------

3. Body of table is considered as single-byte character set (SBCS).

Note: Beye does not support double-byte character set (DBCS)
and multi-byte character set (MBCS).

That's all.
